## Part One:

3 Main buffering Systems
- Carbonic Acid-bicarbonate buffer system
- Respiratory
- kidneys

### Carbonic Buffering System
- Operates in blood, lungs, and kidneys
- Normal relationship  between hc03- and carbonic acid is 20:1
- Body produces unlimited hydrogen, and hc03 for homeostasis

Lungs = H + HC03 <-> H2c03 <-> c02 + h20 = Muscle Tissue

### Kidney Buffering vs Respiratory Buffering
- Resp (determines respiratory side obv)
	- Lungs can adjust carbonic acid by blowing off or holding c02
	- Occurs via chemoreceptors in the midbrain
	- works Minute by minute
- Kidney (determines metabolic side)
	- Can reabsorb or excrete hc03 or H+ as needed
	- Kidneys also make new hc03
	- works hours to days

### ABG Interpretation
- First, Middle, Last Name

- Normal Compensations range:
	- ph        -> 7.35 - 7.45
	- PaCO2  -> 35-45
	- HC03    -> 22-26
	- Pa02     -> 80-100
	- BE         -> -2 / +2

- Systematic Approach
	- First Name
		- Is pH between 7.35 and 7.45
			- Compensated
		- Outisde is uncompensated
	- Last Name
		- Is this Alkalosis or Acidosis
			- < 7.4 is Acid
			- >7.4 is Alkali 
	- Middle Name
		- What is the cause?
			- Look at PaC02 and HC03 to identify.
				- is co2 within normal?
				- is bicarb within normal?
					- if base is low then we have more acids
				- If you have BOTH
					- Mixed Disturbance
						- found more often in post cardiac arrest, drowning, status seizure

### Golden Rules of ABGs
- For Every 10 mmHg change in Pac02 the pH will go in the opposite direction 0.08
- For every 10 mEq/L change in hc03 ph will change 0.15 in the same direction
- For every change in pH of 0.10, K+ will change by 0.6 in the opposite direction

Note: 
	- Intracellular Cation = K+
	- Extracellular Cation = Sodium 


- When there is an increase in hydrogen ions, and thus increase in acidity. There is a shift of cations from intra to extra cellular. Where hydrogen ions push K+ out of the cell.
- Knowing this, with acidosis we can have relatively high K+, and thus should not be treated unless cardiac issues are being seen with it. Treat the acidosis and this will correct as K+ will be able to shift back into the cell once hydrogen cells are less abundent.


## Part 2


#### Causes of Respiratory Acidosis

- Hyperventiliation 
- OD
- COPD
- Chest Trauma
- Neuromuscular Disease
- Airway Obstruction

#### Metabolic Acidosis 
- DKA
- Salicylate OD
- Renal Failure
- Spesis
- Shock
- Severe diarrhea


#### GOLD MARK
- G -> Glycols (Somie medications can cause this, Dilantin)
- O -> Oxoproline (Acetaminophen)
- L -> Lactate (Lactate Production)
	-  Medications can cause this such as Metformin, Glucophage
- D -> Lactate (Propylene Glycol, Tylenol, Short Bowl Syndrome, Chrons)

- M -> Methanol ( Ingestion, common in peds, Window Washer Fluids, Solvents )
- A -> ASA 
- R -> Renal Failure (Pre-Renal, Intra-Renal, Post-Renal)
	- Pre Renal refers to anything that affects volume to the Kidney. 
	- Intra-Renal affects anything with filtering
	- Post Renal is anything after the kidneys
- K -> Ketoacidosis (DKA, Starvation, Chronic ETOH)

##### Base Excess
Refers to the amount of base.
- If you have extra base then you have more base
- If you have negative base then you have more acid'

- Can utilize + Labs to find base excess
	- NA
	- Cl
	- Lactate
	- Ketones
	- Toxic Alcohols

- Anion Gap 
	- Measurement between cations and anions
	- Na+ - (CL + HC03) = uncorrected anion
	- NA+ - (CL + hc03) + K = Corrected anion
- Normal is 16 - 20
- High may indicate a metabolic acidosis


- Respiratory Alkalosis
	- Causes are:
	- Hyperventilation
	- Anxiety
	- Initial Pulmonary Emboli
	- Hypoxia
	- Fever
	- Pregnancy
	- High Altitude
- Metabolic Alkalosis
	- Loss of Gastric Juices
	- Potassium Wasting Diuretics 
	- Overdose on Antacids

### Managing Metabolic Alkalosis
- Reduce GI Suctioning
- Treat Abnormal K+, MG++, NA++, Ca++
	- Low K or Na
	- High Mg or Ca
- Treat Underlying cause
- Acetazolamide 500mg IV
	- Used to remove from Alkalotic state

## Summary
- Acid Base Balance is essential to ventilator strats
- Carbonic Acid is second by second and minute by minute
- Golden Rule of ABGs
- 3 Ways to calculate Anion Gap
- Anion Gap is filled by
	- Keytones, lactate, toxic alcohols
	- If all other sources are ruled out calculating anion gap will most likely lead to underlying etiology
