#### Sodium
- 135 - 145
- Sodium constitutes 90% of cations in extracellular fluid
- Sodium is responsible for determining osmotic pressure
- Causes fluid shifting between extra and intra volumes
- helps to maintain acid base

###### Hyponatremia
	- < 135 Meq/L

#### Chloride
	- 95 - 105 is normal
	- Major anion of extracellular fluid
	- Passively follows sodium and water
	- Deficiency in chloride will lead to deficiency in potassium and vice versa
	- Relationship between K+ and chloride is stronger then sodium and chloride due to the compensation from bicarb

#### Potassium
	- 3.5 - 5.0 
	- Major intracellular cation
	- regulated by kidneys
	- essential for cardiac, muscle and CNS function

##### Hyperkalemia
- > 5.0

```
Acidosis and Alkalosis can cause increased or decreased K+ states.
```

		- hypoKalemia or hypocalcemia causes neuromuscular irritability and mood changes


#### Phosphorus
	3.0 - 4.5
	- provides mineral strength to bone
	- strong relation to P+ and CA++
	- if one is abnormal the other should be checked
		- CA++ is high -> P is low
	- Hyper: Acidotic states; problems with hypocalcemia
		- tetany, seizures, hypotension
	- Hypo:  Alkalotic State, diretics, levels < 1.5 may cause muscle weakness
		- hemolysis of RBC, Bone deformities.
