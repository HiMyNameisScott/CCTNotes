### Goals
- Define how atmosphere plays a role in oxygenation
- Discuss diffusion and oxygen molecule in body
- Discuss V/Q mismatch
- Identify disease processes that play a role in V/Q misatch and shunt


#### Boyles Law
- As Altitude increases pressure decreases and gas in an enclosed space will expand
```
P1V1 = P2V2
P1 = Starting ATM 
V1 = Starting Volume

P2 = Highest ATM based on Highest Altitude
V2 = Ending volume as impacted by the highest Altitude
```

#### Charles Law
- Temperature and volume are proportional to constant atmospheric pressure.
	- As temperature goes up volume goes up.
	- As temperature goes down volum e goes down.

#### Core Points
- Atmospheric pressure is constant
- Proportional relationship of temp / volume
- For every 1000' ascended temp drops 2 degrees C
- For every 150 meters ascended, temp drops 1 degree C

#### Gay-Lussac's Law
- For a given mass and constant volume of gas, the pressure exerted on the sides of its container is directly proportional to its absolute temperature

#### Daltons Law
- Total pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of all gases.
	- Describes how pressure is exerted by a gas at various altitudes
	- Describes how pressure affects the partial pressure of the gas

####  Henry's Law
- The amount of gas dissolved in a solution is directly proportional to the pressure exrted above the gas over the solution.

#### Fick's Law
- The rate of diffusion of a gas across a permeable membrane is determined by:
	- The chemical nature of the membrane
	- Surface Area of the membrane
	- Partial pressure gradiant of a gas across the membrane
	- Thickness of the membrane

#### Graham's Law
- Rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square rute of its molecular weight.
	- This equates to: 
		- Thin Gas = Fast diffusion
		- Thicccc Gas = Slow diffusion


```
Boyles law is the most asked flight phys question on exams
	- Plays more of a role in air medical environment

Boyles explains how gas volumes will increase or decrease inversely to atmospheric pressure.

This is important to think about in some circumstances such as:

	- Volume of air in lungs, stomach, chest, cranium. How will this expand with   increases/decreases of atmospheric pressures related to elevation.

Representations of data
Sea Level = 760 mmHG or 760 tor
- This is 1 atmosphere

Barometric Pressure
Sea Level - 29.92 inHg

![[Pasted image 20230519114558.png]]

#### Clinical Applications of Boyles Law
- Resp Rate and Depth
- Body Cavities
	- Barotitis media
	- Barosinusitis
	- Barodentalgia
	- Barobariatrauma (bends)
	- Pneumothoraxes'
- Equipment
	- ETT cuffs
	- Splints
	- Flow rates on IV sets


#### Barotitis Media (Descent)
- The pressure you have when coming down from altitude, needing the clear the ears.
- This is a decent issue

#### Barosinusitis (Ascent)
- Barosinusitis (ascent problem)
	- As atmospheric pressure drops. Pressure in the sinuses increases.
	- Increase in pressure causes pain, pressure can't go anywhere.

#### Barobariatrauma (Ascent)
- Acts like a decompression sickness
- Found more often in obese patients
	- Fat holds nitrogen
	- Nitrogen narcosis ensues during ascent phase, when we have change in pressures from high (1 atm) to low (1/2 atm) the release of nitrogen is similar to that of bends.
- Treatment
	- High flow o2, that will cause nitrogen to diffuse
	- Treat with o2 prior to flying.
	- high increases of o2 shifts the gradiant to move nitrogen.

#### Barodentalgia (Ascent)
- Inflamed pulp
	- Sharp pain on ascent
- Gum abscess
	- Dull pain on ascent
- Incidence is low
	- Pain is excruciating
- Recent cap or filling leads to increased pressure in the tooth. On ascent the volume expands causing pain.

#### Clinical Applications of Charles's Law
- Gas Law in relation to temperature
- Test Applications
	- Every 1000' = -2c
	- Every 150 meters = -1c
- Affects Equipment more as opposed to patient

#### Clinical Applications of Gay-Lussac's
- "Charles's brother"
- About pressure on sides

#### Clinical Applications of Daltons

- What do we breath
	- 21% Oxygen
	- Nitrogen
		- These gases have their own partial pressures that make up an ATM
- When we add up all of the elements in air we end up with the total pressure
	- This is 1 atm. 
	- 101.3 kPa
```
P1 + .... P5 = Ptotal
```

Pa02 = Partial Pressure of Oxygen in the Arterial Blood

PA02 - Partial Pressure of Oxygen in the Alveoli

```
Example:

ATM @ Sea LEvel: 760 mmHg(tor)

ATM = 1

Oxygen Concentration: 21% or 0.21

Pa02 = 760 x 0.21 -> 159.6

if ATM = 1/2

Oxygen Cocentration: 21%

Pa02= 380 x 0.5 -> 79.8 mmHg

```


#### Clinical Application of Henry's Law (most improtant law)
- The amount of oxygen dissolvedin the capillary blood is directly proprtional to the pressure of oxygen over the capillary blood.
- ** If Partial Pressure of the gas is 2x then on average:
	- Twice as many molecules will hit the surface of the liquid which is then captured in the solution based on the gass solubility.

#### How to affect or apply Henry's Law
- Change Concentration -> Increase Fi02
	- Daltons Law
- Change Surface Area -> add PEEP
	- Fick's Law
- Place the gas under pressure -> BVM or Vent management
	- Henry's Law

#### How to applt Graham's Law
- Law of Diffusion -> Equality
- Gases diffuse until equilibrium occurs.


### Stressors of Flight

- Hypoxia - Altitude changes and partial pressure changes, indifferent stage
- Barometric Pressure 
- Thermal Changes
- Decreased Humidity
- Noise
- Vibration
- Fatigue
- Gravitational Forces
- Flicker Vertigo -> 5 to 20 hx Light through the helicoptor rotors causes the strobe affect
- Spatial Disorientation : Pilots/Members can become dizzy can cause controlled flight into terrain

#### Beside Fi02 Calculation

``` 
pressure is 700 torr
Fio2 = .50

(torr x Fio2) - 50 -> (350) - 50 -> 300 Calculated Pa02
```
