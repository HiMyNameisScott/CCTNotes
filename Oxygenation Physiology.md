- Define Cellular Respiration
	- Aerobic vs anaerobic metabolsim
	- Define ATP Production
	- Define process of Inadequate oxygenation.

#### V/Q Mistmatch
- V - Ventiliation, are we deliving Gas
- Q is the Abbreviation for Flow 
	- Cardiac Output
- Ventilation Problem in the context of air delivery
- Mismatch can be caused by
	- blockage
	- edema
	- pneumonia
- Pulmonary Shunt:
	- Alveoli are perfused with blood as nromal but ventilation(supply of o2) fails to supply perfusion needs.
- If we effect
	- Increase dissolvable o2 by increasing partial pressure
	- increase surface tension with peep
	- should lead to an increase in presentation
	- most will improve

##### Presentation for early V/Q Shunt
- Tachypnea in response to hypoxia
- Abg: ph 7.56 PaCO2 22 HC03 25 Pa02 51
	- Uncompensated Respiratory Alkalosis 

#### V/Q Mismatch
- DO2 = Q x Ca02
- Dead Space ventilation
	- Find Reversable causes, may not be due to lack of oxygentation
	- Refered to as "Dead Space Ventilation" because oxygenation at the ventilation is appropriate, but Q is not working. Thus No amount of ventilation will fix this.
- Respiratory Failure will not change despite 02
	- Dead Space Ventilation due to Q Failure
		- Cardiogenic Shock
		- Pulmonary Emboli
		- Blood is not catching with gas

#### Overall Disease Processes that cause VQ Mismatch
- COPD
	- May have elevated levels which a normal patient won't have
- Asthma
- Trauma
	- Hypemic Hypoxia, Hemmorage issues more likely cause
- Pneumonia
	- Oxygenation Failure, due to the way o2 and co2 dissolve in a fluid
- ARDS

##### Questions to ask
- Oxygenation issue
- Air movement issues


### Aerobic Metabolism
- Cellular Aerobic metabolism is dependent on:
	- Adequate o2
	- Ability to carry o2
	- Ability to move o2
	- Ability to extract o2 to cells

### ATP Production
- Aerobic metabolism of ATP requires glucose and o2
- Lack of either produces lactic acid
- Lactate is used as a biofuel 


### Delivery of Oxygen

DO2 = Q x Ca02

- Q 
	-  Stroke Volume
		- Preload
			- Low Pressure side
		- Afterload
			- Systemic Vascular Resistance
			- Left Ventricular Pressure
		- Contractility
			- Proper squeeze in the heart
	- Heart Rate
		- To Fast To Slow
			- Medications that change this, shock, hear issues
- Ca02
	- Blood on hemoglobin and in plasma
	- 1.34 x Hgb x (Sa02) this is 97-98% of o2 on blood
	- +
	- Pa02 x 0.003 this is the last 2 -3 % of o2 on blood

#### Definitions
- Pa02  = Partial PRessure of oxygen dissolved in the blood
- P02 = Partial pressure of oxygen in the given environment
- PA02 = Partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli
- Sa02 = Amount of HGB in the blood that are saturated
- Sp02 = The total saturation of oxygen bound to hgb
- Sv02 = Mixed venous oxygen saturation ( Pulmonary Artery Cath)
- Scv02 = Central Venous Oxygen Saturation
- Ca02 = Total content of oxygen bound to Hgb
- D02 = Delivery of oxygen each minute

- Each gram of hgb carries 1.34 mL o2
- hgb is measured in g/Dl

##### Fick Formula
- Cellular uptake of 02
	- cv02 = 1.34 x hgb X sv02 + pa02 x 0.003
- What is the biggest impact in oxygen delivery, hgb

#### Identifiable Causes for hypoxia
- hypoxia hypoxia - deficiency in alveolar 02 exchange
- Hypemic hypoxia - Reduction in o2 carrying
- Stagnant hypoxia - Obstructuve shock, decreased Q, heart failure, PE
- Histotoxic Hypoxia - Poisoning, metabolic disorders such as cyanide, etoh or CO


#### 3 ps
- Do they have a pulse
- Perfusion (map > 65)
- PH ( low ph ?)


#### Oxygenn Dissociation Curve
- Oxygen and hgb curve
- 

#### Bohr Effect
- Hemoglobin's oxygen binding affinity is inversely related to both the acidity and concentration of carbon dioxide

#### Right Shift
- Decreased affinity for oxygen, better drop off capability
	- Raised Temp
	- Raised Acid
	- Raised 2-3-DPG
		- Molecule that helps to offload hemoglobin
	- Raised pa02
- R - Raised Acid
- R - Raised c02
- R - Raised Temp
- R - Raised 2-3 DPG
- R - Raised pa02

#### Left Shift
- Oxygen does not want to unbid from hem receptors
- Low Temp
- Low Acid
- Low 2-3 DPG
- Low pa02
